Plan for Implementing Backup and Restore Feature with Custom Path Selection
Analysis of Current System
Based on the code provided, I can see this is a Django-based MOOE Liquidation Management System with React frontend. The system currently lacks backup/restore functionality.

Implementation Plan
Phase 1: Backend Implementation (Django)
Create Backup/Restore Models

Add a Backup model to track backup operations

Add fields for path, timestamp, status, and file size

Implement Backup Service

Create a service that can export database and media files

Support multiple formats (JSON, CSV, SQL dump)

Allow custom path selection

Implement Restore Service

Create a service to validate and import backup files

Handle database migrations and data integrity

Add API Endpoints

/api/backup/ - Initiate backup with path parameter

/api/restore/ - Initiate restore with file selection

/api/backups/ - List existing backups

Phase 2: Frontend Implementation (React)
Create Backup/Restore UI Components

Backup modal with path selection

Restore modal with file browser

Status indicators and progress bars

Integrate with Existing Admin Dashboard

Add backup/restore section to admin panel

Connect to API endpoints

Implement File Browser

Custom component for path selection

Support for both server-side and client-side path selection

Phase 3: Security & Validation
Add Permission Controls

Restrict to admin users only

Validate file paths to prevent directory traversal attacks

Implement Validation

Verify backup file integrity before restoration

Confirmations for destructive operations
