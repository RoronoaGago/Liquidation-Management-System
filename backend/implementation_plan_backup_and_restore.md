Plan for Implementing Backup and Restore Feature with Custom Path Selection
Analysis of Current System
Based on the code provided, I can see this is a Django-based MOOE Liquidation Management System with React frontend. The system currently lacks backup/restore functionality.

Implementation Plan
Phase 1: Backend Implementation (Django)
Create Backup/Restore Models

Add a Backup model to track backup operations

Add fields for path, timestamp, status, and file size

Implement Backup Service

Create a service that can export database and media files

Support multiple formats (JSON, CSV, SQL dump)

Allow custom path selection

Implement Restore Service

Create a service to validate and import backup files

Handle database migrations and data integrity

Add API Endpoints

/api/backup/ - Initiate backup with path parameter

/api/restore/ - Initiate restore with file selection

/api/backups/ - List existing backups

Phase 2: Frontend Implementation (React)
Create Backup/Restore UI Components

Backup modal with path selection

Restore modal with file browser

Status indicators and progress bars

Integrate with Existing Admin Dashboard

Add backup/restore section to admin panel

Connect to API endpoints

Implement File Browser

Custom component for path selection

Support for both server-side and client-side path selection

Phase 3: Security & Validation
Add Permission Controls

Restrict to admin users only

Validate file paths to prevent directory traversal attacks

Implement Validation

Verify backup file integrity before restoration

Confirmations for destructive operations

Proposed Implementation Details


Short answer: No. With your current settings, backups are saved under the project folder: BACKUP_SETTINGS['DEFAULT_BACKUP_DIR'] = BASE_DIR/Backups, i.e., inside your backend project, not your Desktop.
If you want them on your Desktop, set a full absolute path in settings and restart the server, for example on Windows:
In backend/proj_backend/backend/settings.py, set:
BACKUP_SETTINGS = {
'DEFAULT_BACKUP_DIR': r'C:\Users\johnrick\Desktop\Backups',
'MAX_BACKUP_AGE_DAYS': 30,
'ALLOW_CUSTOM_PATHS': False,
'COMPRESSION_LEVEL': 6,
}
Make sure the folder exists (the code will create it if it can).
