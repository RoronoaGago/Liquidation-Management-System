### Setup Steps

Follow these instructions to get your frontend environment ready and the development server running:

1.  **Navigate to the Frontend Directory**
    First, ensure you are in the root directory of your project, then change into the `frontend` directory:

    ```bash
    cd frontend
    ```

2.  **Install Dependencies**
    Install all the necessary project dependencies. This command reads your `package.json` file and installs the required packages:

    ```bash
    npm i
    ```

3.  **Run the Development Server**
    Start the frontend development server. This will typically open your application in a web browser, often at `http://localhost:5173/` or a similar address:
    ```bash
    npm run dev
    ```

Your frontend development server should now be up and running!
